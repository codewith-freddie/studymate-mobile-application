## 🏗️ Development Methodology

The **Modified Waterfall Model** was chosen as the development methodology for StudyMate due to its structured and sequential approach, which ensured clear project phases and precise documentation. This model proved effective in systematically progressing through requirement gathering, design, development, and testing phases. Additionally, the inclusion of feedback loops allowed the team to revisit and refine previous phases when necessary. This adaptability ensured that any errors or new requirements identified during later stages could be addressed without compromising the overall project structure.
